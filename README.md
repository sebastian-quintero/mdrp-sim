# mdrp-sim

This is a Meal Delivery Routing Problem Simulator (hence the name).
As such, it is a computational framework for solving the Meal Delivery Routing Problem. 
The computational framework consists of a simulated environment where different policies can be tested.
These policies consist of:

- Dispatching (assignment + routing) policies
- Movement (for couriers) policies
- Fleet allocation policies

Please follow this short guide to get the project up and running.
A short explanation of this repo's directories can also be found.
